I manage my Ubuntu server very regularly, running a wide variety of applications from inside virtual machines. More recently I've been deploying some internal services within Docker as well. I run multiple websites via the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). I also have some instances of Mongo, Cassandra as well as Gitlab used in personal development.
