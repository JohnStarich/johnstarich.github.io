A site designed from the ground up as _the_ product search engine. Remember those "advanced search" checkboxes and dropdowns? No more. Remember those advertisements constantly trying to tell you what you want? Gone. How about we actually show you the products you wanted by just typing your query in? With Noonian, we aim to move beyond the negative tendencies and shortcomings typically associated with product search to produce an experience truly deserving of its users' respect.


Currently a work in progress. You can check it out [here](http://noonian.com/).
