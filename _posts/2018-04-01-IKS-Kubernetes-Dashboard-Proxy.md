The Kubernetes Dashboard is a great way to see what's going on in your Kubernetes cluster. We created a service that uses IBM Cloud's authentication to provide convenient access to that dashboard in [IKS][iks]. My co-worker, [Chris Kirkland][chris], wrote a great [blog post][blog] to announce the new service.

I added monitoring, alerting, and improved the user experience for our each of our failure modes. Today, my team and I continue to maintain and further develop the service.
