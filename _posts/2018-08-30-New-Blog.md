# Kicking off my new blog

I've finally rearranged my site enough now to launch a blog!
I'm not sure what the content will look like yet, but I think I'll put up some lessons learned from the various projects I've worked on.
I may even add some other cool stuff I've picked up along the way.

Who knows? This could even be fun!
