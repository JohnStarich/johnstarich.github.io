I have returned to my team that I have worked with for a year and a half to develop IBM Cloud Autoscaling Services. Previously I have worked in a few of our microservices such as the primary engine for scaling apps, the event processing engine, and the metrics aggregation service. I will likely work on more services our team manages and also maintain some of the services we already have underway.

Check back for more project information soon...
