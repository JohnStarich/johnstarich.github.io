I have returned to the team I worked with to develop IBM Cloud auto-scaling Services. Previously I worked with a few of our microservices such as the primary engine for scaling apps, the event processing engine, and the metrics aggregation service. I will likely work on more services our team manages and also maintain some of the services we already have underway.

Check back for more project information soon...
