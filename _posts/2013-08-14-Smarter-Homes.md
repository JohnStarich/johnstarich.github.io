I am currently the webmaster and iOS developer for Smarter Homes of Austin.
As webmaster, I am responsible for adding content to the site and optimizing it to draw search engine traffic.

As the iOS developer, I work on an application for internal use. It is used  to more effectively perform their bookkeeping and make sales by keeping prices and inventory readily available.
