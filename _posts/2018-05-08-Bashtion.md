A framework for writing reusable and testable modules in Bash. Sometimes using Bash is simply inescapable, but large legacy scripts can be hard to manage. I sought to create a framework that would make it easy to gradually improve legacy code.

Bashtion encourages modular, reusable, and testable code. It does this by setting up Bash with sensible defaults, a built-in error tracing system, support for writing tests, and generates warnings for deviations from best practices. The project is open source and you can check it out [on GitHub][github].
