Noonian is a research tool for finding the laptop that fits your needs. You can search for laptops and then run comparisons to narrow down your choices quickly.

Later on, the plan is to open this up to comparing builds of different computers and their components.
With Noonian, I aim to avoid the negative tendencies and shortcomings typically associated with product search by making it easier to shop smarter.

Currently a work in progress. [You can check it out here!](http://noonian.com/)
