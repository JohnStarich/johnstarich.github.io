Noonian is a research tool for finding the laptop that fits your needs. You can search for laptops and then run comparisons to narrow down your choices quickly. Check it out at [noonian.com](https://noonian.com).

Later on, the plan is to open this up to comparing builds of different computers and their components.
With Noonian, I aim to avoid the negative tendencies and shortcomings typically associated with product search by making it easier to shop smarter.
