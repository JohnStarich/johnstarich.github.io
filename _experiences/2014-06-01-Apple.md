With Mac Quality I worked on two utility websites to enable others in Product Integrity to access, manipulate, and customize the data collected from the machine testing process.


In two weeks, I built a front end web service for Product Integrity personnel to access individual test runs and all associated data in one place.


I worked closely with another intern to create a second web service. It enables anyone in QA, with permissions, to edit a project's information used in reports. I created the interface for QA to customize test run summary output, which increases division efficiency. We made the project modification process significantly faster. The end result is condensed detail page information so that it is far more readable and concise.
