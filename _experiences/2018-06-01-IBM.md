I develop and maintain IBM Cloud's Kubernetes Service cluster management API microservices &amp; CLI, the Web Terminal cluster addon &amp; proxy microservice, and the Kubernetes Dashboard proxy microservice to name a few.

Over the past year I [overhauled the CLI user experience][CLI UX] and created the [Web Terminal cluster addon][kube-terminal] & its proxy. Within my larger team, I've also helped launch a global API to unify the IKS region-specific APIs and cluster management APIs for both [VPC][] and [RedHat OpenShift][openshift].

Most of our services are written in [Go][] and some, like the Web Terminal, use JavaScript/CSS/HTML for the front-end.
