As the webmaster for Smarter Homes of Austin, I was responsible for adding content to the site and optimizing it to draw search engine traffic. As the iOS developer, I worked on a point-of-sales application. It helped them more effectively perform their bookkeeping and make sales by keeping prices and inventory readily available.
