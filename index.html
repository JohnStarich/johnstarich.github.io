		<h2><span class="subject">All-Purpose Server</span> &ndash; Personal Project</h2>
		I manage my Ubuntu server from afar, typically, running a wide variety of applications from inside virtual machines. I run multiple websites via the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). I also have some instances of Mongo, Cassandra as well as Gitlab used in personal development. I've even begun playing with OpenStack on this personal server via CentOS.

		<h2><span class="subject">Arc</span> &ndash; Thirdship</h2>
		The beginning of our Java game project we decided that, since we knew nothing about games, developing the game engine would give us valuable insight into how games ought to be developed. In the process of creating the Arc reactor, we learned how to work as a tight team with a powerful focus on making an intuitive game library API. With OpenGL, we built the reactor in Java and we probably spent more time arguing about the right name for a method than actually writing the code. (Which did result in a beautifully crafted API!) In the end, we realized the project was way over our heads in terms of making it performant and as capable as we needed for the aforementioned game, yet we learned a great deal in teamwork, code management techniques, and in API development.

		<h2><span class="subject">Noonian</span> &ndash; Thirdship</h2>
		<p>
			A site designed from the ground up as <em>the</em> product search engine. Remember those "advanced search" checkboxes and dropdowns? No more. Remember those advertisements constantly trying to tell you what you want? Gone. How about we actually show you the products you wanted by just typing your query in? With Noonian, we aim to move beyond the negative tendencies and shortcomings typically associated with product search to produce an experience truly deserving of its users' respect.

			Currently a work in progress. You can check it out <a href="http://noonian.com/">here</a>.

		<h2><span class="subject">Web Developer Intern</span> &ndash; Apple Inc.</h2>
		<p>
			With Mac Quality, during the summer of 2014, I worked on two utility websites to enable others in Product Integrity to access, manipulate, and customize the data collected from the machine testing process.
		</p>
		<p>
			In two weeks, I built a front end web service for Product Integrity personnel to access individual test runs and all associated data in one place.
		</p>
		<p>
			I worked closely with another intern to create a second web service. It enables anyone in QA, with permissions, to edit a project's information used in reports. I created the interface for QA to customize test run summary output, which increases division efficiency. We made the project modification process significantly faster. The end result is condensed detail page information so that it is far more readable and concise.
