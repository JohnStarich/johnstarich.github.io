I run an Ubuntu server remotely, where I manage multiple virtual machines for all of my web services. I run three websites, Git services for myself, several databases, a couple game servers, and a Teamspeak server for talking with my friends in a Skype-like environment.

As of late, I have been transitioning most of those services into Docker containers. I have also been experimenting with Docker swarm and how best to automate the deployment and scaling of multiple instances for each service.

Most recently I have set up a Tomcat container to deploy some Java apps to. I also have a Jenkins container automatically building and deploying from multiple Github repositories. This has made my school projects an absolute breeze because I can spend all my time on the code rather than worrying about deploying it.
