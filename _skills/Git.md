I started using Git in my first few years of learning Java (2011) to develop my Minecraft mods. Some time later I began using proper Git workflows to work on Arc as a more effective team.

When I went to Apple (2014) we used Git extensively to manage our code and our production releases. I began to learn how to use Git Flow with the develop and master branches following as upstream destinations from my feature branches.

Following my work there, I began working on Noonian with 3 of my friends. During this time we practiced Git all the time. We all worked on our separate work flows and merged toward develop to test stability in staging followed by a merge to master and deploying to production.
