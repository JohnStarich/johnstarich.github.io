Just before starting at IBM as an intern in Cloud Foundational Services (2015), I jumped into crash courses in Python to prepare myself for the position. Realizing the language's relative simplicity to my previous study of programming languages, Python was very easy for me to pick up.

Right now I am working at IBM under a co-op so that I may continue to attend school. My team has developed most of our back-end services in Python, some of which I have been working hard to understand and contribute to.
I even helped write one of our services, a metrics collection service, with my co-workers.
