In the Noonian project we decided that we would use Scala instead of our previous experience being only in Java. Soon, we realized that we had chosen a language that put us completely out of our depth. After almost three years, our Noonian team has grasped most of the Scala concepts needed to write our application.

We have learned to use a strong balance of both functional and object-oriented design concepts. Without holding too strongly to either standard, we are able to create powerful and effective solutions to our problems.
