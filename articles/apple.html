	<h2>Apple Web Developer Intern</h2>
	With Mac Quality, during the summer of 2014, I worked on two utility websites to enable others in Product Integrity to access, manipulate, and customize the data collected from the machine testing process.
	<ul>
		<li>In two weeks, built a front end web service for Product Integrity personnel to access individual test runs and all associated data in one place</li>
		<li>Worked closely with another intern, created a second web service:
			<ul>
				<li>Enabled anyone in QA, with permissions, to edit a project's information used in reports</li>
				<li>Created interface for QA to customize test run summary output, increasing division efficiency</li>
				<li>Made the project modification process significantly faster</li>
				<li>Condensed detail page information to be far more readable and concise</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
